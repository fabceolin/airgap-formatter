# NFR Assessment: 10.8

Date: 2026-01-28
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - No XSS/sanitization tests; CSP validation missing
- Performance: PASS - Clear targets (100ms/500KB, 500ms/diagram, 2s total) with test methodology
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Missing offline mode verification; cross-browser acceptable differences undefined
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test artifacts not created; manual-only testing

## Critical Issues

1. **No XSS/Sanitization Test Cases** (Security)
   - Risk: Markdown/Mermaid injection could bypass sanitization
   - Fix: Add explicit XSS payload test cases in Task 4 or new security-focused task

2. **Missing Offline Mode Test** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Mermaid.js may require network in edge cases
   - Fix: Add offline mode test to Task 8 (browser offline mode + verify rendering)

3. **Test Artifacts Not Created** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Testing cannot proceed without test documents
   - Fix: Create test-data/ files before testing begins (Task 1 prerequisite)

## Quick Wins

- Add XSS test payloads to test-data/markdown-edge-cases.md
- Add "Test offline mode" checkbox to cross-browser test matrix
- Create test-data/ files as first task
